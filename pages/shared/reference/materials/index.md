# Physically Based Rendering (PBR)
Physically Based Rendering, or PBR, is a powerful modern shading technique introduced in Strata. The PBR shader uses a special texture, called an MRAO map, to interpret lighting in a more realistic fashion compared to stock specular shaders, and is already commonly used in modern game engines, such as Source 2 and the Unreal Engine to produce amazing, high-definition textures. This category contains any information pertaining to the PBR shader.
