# PROGRAMMING

## sourcepp

[sourcepp](https://github.com/craftablescience/sourcepp) - modern open-source collection of libraries written in C++20 to parse Valve formats, with Python wrappers included.

**Use Cases:**
* You need a sane parser for most Valve file formats associated with the Source Engine.
* Something more "modern", thanks to its C++20 implementation.
* A swiss-army knife powerhouse of parsers.

* Strata Source Team & Contributors

## VTFLib

> [!CAUTION]
> VTFLib has some "quirks" from the old days of Source and from its age. One such thing is that VTFLib cannot parse textures which's dimensions aren't power of 2, and has middling error handling.

[VTFLib](https://github.com/NeilJed/VTFLib) - open-source C/C++ library meant for parsing and working with the Valve Texture Format (VTF).
The original VTFCmd and VTFEdit are part of the same repository.

**Use Cases:**
* If you want to have a reliable, yet archaic VTF library.
* When sourcepp's vtfpp does not support a feature that VTFLib does.

* Neil "Jed" Jedrzejewski
* Ryan "Nemesis" Gregg

## datamodel-rs

[datamodel-rs](https://crates.io/crates/datamodel) - work-in-progress Rust library meant for serialization and deserialization of Valve's DMX format, supporting binary v1-5, KV2 and KV2_flat.

**Use Cases:**
* DMX/KV2 are rather commonly used around Source 1/2 (such as the .vmap file format which is DMX binary v4, the DMX model, particle files), sourcepp only supports the Binary version of DMX, but not the ASCII encoded version of DMX (KeyValues2), as a result, if you for some reason need to support the ASCII encoded one aswell, this is the choice.
* Want to write a tool/CLI/app for DMX/KV2 files in Rust rather than C/C++

**Use Cases:**
* If you find yourself working a lot with the human-readable text-based Source formats, it is a very good option.
