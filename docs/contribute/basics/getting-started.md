must adhere to these guidelines

### Pages Have To

- Be related to Strata Source.
- Not be a duplicate of an existing page.

- Contain formal, passive language. No `"I think..."` or `"Next you go to..."`.

### Please Do

- Add links wherever possible.
- Use proper, rich.
  [Markdown styling](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

### Please Don't

- Add malicious links or (any) downloads.

## Setting Up The Wiki For Local Edits

In order to add/edit articles and test how they will appear in the Strata Wiki, the Wiki's documentation source repository should be locally cloned.

This is recommend before making a Pull Request in the documentation repository to make sure changes work and appear correctly. The source can be clone here in the [StrataSource/Wiki](https://github.com/StrataSource/Wiki) repository.

> [!WARNING]
> Please make sure to not get mixed up with the [StrataSource/strata-wiki](https://github.com/StrataSource/strata-wiki) repository.
> This repository is not the documentation repository but instead the source code for the Strata Wiki itself.
>
> While this does get cloned with the documentation repository on first run, it should not need to be edited in order to add/edit articles to the wiki.

Please follow the README instructions in the `StrataSouce/Wiki` repository to finish setting up the Wiki once it has been cloned.

After reading the guidelines and setting up the local instance of the Strata Wiki, continue to [editing articles](editing-articles).
