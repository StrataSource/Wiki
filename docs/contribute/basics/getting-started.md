must adhere to these guidelines

### Pages Have To

- Be related to Strata Source.
- Not be a duplicate of an existing page.

- Contain formal, passive language. No `"I think..."` or `"Next you go to..."`.

### Please Do

- Add links wherever possible.

  [Markdown styling](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## Setting Up The Wiki For Local Edits

In order to add/edit articles and test how they will appear in the Strata Source Wiki, the Wiki's documentation source repository should be locally cloned.

Before opening a pull request, it's suggested that you clone and build the wiki locally to ensure your changes work correctly.

The source can be cloned from [StrataSource/Wiki](https://github.com/StrataSource/Wiki).

> [!WARNING]
> Please make sure to not get mixed up with the [StrataSource/strata-wiki](https://github.com/StrataSource/strata-wiki) repository.
> This repository is not the documentation repository but instead the source code for the Strata Source Wiki itself.
>
> While this does get cloned with the documentation repository on first run, it should not need to be edited in order to create/edit articles on the wiki.

Please follow the README instructions in the `StrataSource/Wiki` repository to finish setting up the Wiki once it has been cloned.

After reading the guidelines and setting up the local instance of the Strata Source Wiki, continue to [Creating & Editing Articles](creating-editing-articles).
