# The Workshop: What Is It?
Like Portal 2, Portal 2: Community Edition has a workshop where users can upload their own maps for others to play. Portal 2: CE's workshop, however, can do much more than just maps. Similar to the Left 4 Dead 2 and Black Mesa workshops, entire mod-packs or multi-map campaigns can be in the same addon. But it doesn't have to be just maps, addons can consist of just material reskins or remodels, or even entire game ports. 

# How do I upload an addon to the workshop?
To upload an addon to the workshop, you will have to use the Workshop Uploader. You can launch the Workshop Uploader from the SDK Launcher, and instructions on how to use the Uploader can be found on [This Page](/modding/workshop/workshopgui).

# How do I get my subscribed addons to work?
In the main menu, you will find a button labeled "Addons". Click on this, and you will get a list of all your installed addons. Check the boxes of the addons you want mounted, click apply, and now your addons are mounted to Portal 2: Community Edition. For now, maps can only be run through the console.
