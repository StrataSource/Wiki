# BSP Support

This is an overview of which versions of the BSP map file format Strata Source
can launch. Some formats can be converted to a supported version by
manipulating the raw binary data, while others would need decompilation with an
appropriate tool, which might break certain properties without manual
intervention.

Furthermore, it's not guaranteed that every format that is listed as supported
works 100% since there might still be game-specific incompatiblities.

Source 2 is not supported at all as its formats aren't documented and completely
different from what's supported in Source.
