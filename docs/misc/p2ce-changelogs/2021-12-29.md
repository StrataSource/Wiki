Portal 2: Community Edition - 0.6.9 (Released to playtest_beta)
- Added texture streaming from csgo
- Added threaded logging from csgo
- Added demo indexing from csgo
- Added anisotropic filtering in dx11
- Added equippable long-fall boots item
- Added the ability for player fall damage to be enabled again
- Added `GiveBoots` `RemoveBoots` `GivePaintGunFull` `GivePaintGunBasic` `RemovePortalGun` and `RemovePaintGun` inputs to logic_playerproxy

- Fixed crash when setting custom model on cubes
- Game no longer releases US keyboard layout if it previously existed in the system
- Clamped Portals_ResizeAll values to reasonable limits
- EmitLaser will no longer create mutliple lasers on cubes when called multiple times if a laser exists already
- Fixed some tiny physics bugs that may or may not have been a problem in the first place

- Fixed crash when running DX11 with MSAA
- Fixed crash when map has too many decals 
- Fixed crash when drawing func_breakable_surf 
- Fixed some misc shader things
- Fixed crash with env_screenoverlay

- Fixed FOV reset on screen resolution change
- Fixed mdlcompile, fbx2dmx and mdlinfo on Linux

Oh yeah, Linux users: the low level time code has move from `gettimeofday` to `clock_gettime` with `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`. In short, this ensures time is always increasing. With the previous implementation, system time changes could cause discontinuities in certain measurements (e.g. UI transitions may complete instantly if your system time jumps forward). Keep an eye out for any oddities (or improvements) caused by this change. I doubt you'll notice anything though.
