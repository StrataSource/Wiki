0.9.0 has been released to **nightly**, **default** and all other branches.

Most notably, we've nuked DX9 entirely and are now DX11 only. Please report any DX11 bugs asap, we'd like to fix any remaining ones.
BSP limits has also been merged into main, the bsp-limits branch has been retired as a result.

If you absolutely need dx9 for some reason, use the dx9-final branch on steam.
