**0.5.5 has been released!**

This is a big one.

__Changes ported from Momentum's Hammer__
We ported everything, which is a lot. Here are the highlights:
```
* Added keybind editor
* Added viewport color editor
* Make Color-picker Keyvalue fields recolor its field with the selected color

* Hammer now stores brush vertex coordinates in the vmf. This solves the floating point precision error for complex, off-grid brushes on repeating map-loads
* Unknown textures now use the iconic purple/black checkerboard pattern in texture browser
```

__Crosshair__
```
* Added cvar portalgun_crosshair_mode. 0 = Portal 2 mode | 1 = Portal 1 mode
* Fixed Portal 2's crosshair being always filled when holding the single-portal-gun
```

__vgui_movie_display__
```
* Added keyvalue "noscanline" to disable the scanline overlay
* Added keyvalues to set the UV min/max coordinates directly, instead of having to use inputs
* Videos no longer restart when pausing the game
* Videos can now play audio (The sound comes from everywhere and doesn't respect volume. This is an early implementation)
```

__Panorama__
```
* The engine is now able to load panorama code. There is no panorama UI yet, so the game will default to VGUI, but the functionality is there
```

__Other__
```
* Added -V parameter to vpk.exe to select which VPK version should be used
* vpk.exe no longer strips _dir from single-chunk VPKs
* The game now saves files into the modwrapper's directory instead of P2CE's
* Added volumetric gaussian blur and downsample to alleviate jaggedness issue
* Linux improvements and fixes
* Added some Half-Life 2 compatibility
* Much internal cleanup
