# Portal 2: Community Edition - November 23rd, 2025 Update

## Additions (22)
- Added a "client" time version for Sound Operators `output_entry_elapsed` and `output_stop_elapsed` which use game client time instead of host time
- Added a note to the top of a VMF file if it's saved with any Strata extensions
- Added command `cl_particles_dump_json` to dump particle operators to a file
- Added command `mat_reloadtexture` to reload a specific texture
- Added command `steam_cloud_list`
- Added commands `sv_particles_reload`/`cl_particles_reload` to reload particles
- Added ConVar `cl_pause_on_steam_overlay` for whether singleplayer game should pause when Steam Overlay is opened
- Added ConVar `cl_portal_crosshair_auto_scale`, which when set to 1 mimics Portal 1 and Portal: Revolution crosshair scaling
- Added ConVar `save_check_for_mismatch`. When true, the game will not load saves which were taken on old map versions and fires a `save_map_version_mismatch` event
- Added ConVar `scene_preferloose` to control whether the game should load loose VCDs or cached VCDs first
- Added ConVar `sv_exactbasevelocity`, which fixes basevelocity boosters giving entities an extra half tick worth of basevelocity
- Added ConVar `sv_mainmenu_chapter_override`
- Added ConVar `sv_player_use_radius` to control player use radius
- Added ConVar `sv_portal_sp_door_crush` (off by default) which lets players be crushed by `prop_testchamber_door` in single player
- Added ConVar `sv_teleport_snaps_velocity`, which makes `trigger_teleport` entities with "UseLandmarkAngles 1" rotate the teleported entity's horizontal velocity to match the destination angles in addition to rotating the entity's angles
- Added ConVars `save_hud_autosave` and `save_hud`. These are utility ConVars to manage UI state
- Added ConVars `save_screenshot_res_x`, `save_screenshot_res_y`, `save_screenshot_res_aspect` and `save_screenshot_res_fov`. Settings for game save screenshots
- Added game events `portal_placed` and `portal_fizzled`
- Added game events `save_begin`, `save_map_version_mismatch`, and `map_load_failed`
- Added startup parameter `-bordered` which will force the game to start with window border
- Allow directly adding ZIP files as search paths
- Restored the `stats` command

## Local Addons (10)
This update includes a new local addons system. Local addons allow us to implement small, toggleable adjustments to various aspects of the game, without directly editing the engine's code. If you have made an addon in the past or are interested in producing local addons for P2:CE, see here for submission guidelines / info: https://github.com/StrataSource/p2ce-addons
A list of local addons which have already been added can be found below:
- Added "Portal 1 Portal Gun" local addon
  - This replaces the portal gun's viewmodel, particles and SFX with Portal 1's, and changes the particles and sfx for portals (Special thanks to Electrodynamite12 for providing updated particles!)
- Added "Personality Sphere Visual Updates" local addon
  - This provides general improvements for personality spheres and related models.
- Added "Old Schrödinger Cubes" local addon
  - This replaces the Schrödinger cube model with a version from earlier in development.
- Added "Refractive Fizzlers" local addon
  - This adds a refractive visual effect to all fizzler types.
- Added "Unused Turret VO" local addon
  - This reimplements any unused Turret voicelines found within Portal 2's files, and adds script logic to restore lines designed to play if Turrets become blocked by a Hard Light Bridge.
- Added "Updated Media" local addon
  - Provides a method of toggling the changes made to menu backgrounds, loading screens and the post-credits cutscene.
- Added "Player Blood" local addon
  - This re-enables player blood, as seen in Portal 1
- Added "Adhesion/Reflection Gel Assets" local addon
  - This implements Adhesion/Reflection gel-related assets (Special thanks to lenship2 for creating this local addon!)
- Added "Dynamic Light Bridge Lights" local addon
  - This makes Hard Light Bridges cast light on the surroundings, as seen in our ["Clustered Graphics Showcase"](https://youtu.be/5ovDgRtosGA). Warning, can be very expensive on lower-end hardware!
