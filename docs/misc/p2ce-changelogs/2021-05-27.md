**0.5.7 has arrived!**

Lots of fixes with this one. Huge thanks to everyone on the P2CE and Momentum for all the fixes and improvements!

- Added parallax corrected cubemaps for DX11 (Not added to DX9 because of the massive combo count)
- Added game_sounds_manifest.txt which *should* fix most mounted sounds not playing
- Added -allowmultiple launch flag
- Added -dx11 launch parameter (Previously you had to do -shaderapi shaderapidx11 to run the game with dx11)
- Added support for Discord rich presence when running Hammer through proton/wine
- Added button to hammer to toggle sprite rendering (from Tewan)
- Re-added postcompiler libraries, as they were mistakenly ignored in git
- Enabled Panorama debugger for dx11
- Fixed vgui font sizes on Linux
- Fixed title and message being swapped in message boxes for Windows
- Fixed portal placement being broken on Linux 
- r_rootlod is no longer locked behind a launch param
- Improved the panorama SVG loader. Should support most SVGs now 
- Fixed US keyboard layout being selected and never un-selected by the game
- Loose files now override the Panorama PBIN
- The Panorama PBIN's signature is no longer checked
- Fixed laser cube particles
- Fill tags on the root SVG element are now properly handled
- sv_max_allowed_net_graph now defaults to 2 
- sv_airaccelerate now defaults to 10 instead of 12 to match the Portal 2 default
- Fixed rendering of Panorama main menu in DX9
- Fixed misc. culling bugs in both DX9 and DX11 (related to panorama main menu issue)
- Fixed VBSP searching in bin/ instead of p2ce/ for the FGD. If VBSP cannot find the FGD, instances are collapsed to world origin
- On first run, the game now defaults to fullscreen instead of borderless windowed
- Fixed crash when carrying objects with the gravity gun through a portal
- Fixed hammer lightmap grid view not properly displaying 
- The game no longer creates a mutex when running with -allowmultiple/-multirun. This makes it easier to run certain source games side-by-side with p2ce
- Fixed panorama not loading background videos
- The cvarlist command now prints console command flags instead of just cvar flags
- Removed hammer/hammer redundant folder
