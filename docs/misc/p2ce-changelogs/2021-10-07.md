Update to **playtest_beta**
- Added a panorama console (huge thanks to @BLT [again]). We're aware of some small problems with it, please avoid opening issues regarding the console without discussing it with us in #beta-reports
- All dx11 shaders have been recompressed using zstd. Should be quite a bit smaller now. 
- Updated the sass parser
- Fixed another crash on Linux due to incorrect alignment 
- Fixed a crash on Linux when the game loads a map. (Thanks a lot gcc..)

As stated in the past, we do not officially support Windows 7. Hammer no longer runs on Windows 7 due to some changes introduced in Qt 6. We don't want to spend time reverting changes to Qt and testing them in a Windows 7 VM, so it will not be fixed. 
Sorry to any windows 7 users out there.
