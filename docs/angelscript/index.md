# AngelScript

Welcome to the AngelScript section of the Strata Source wiki!

AngelScript is a scripting system developed outside of Strata Source to provide a interface between the user and the game internals allowing for developing various custom game functionality without the need for source code access. For more information on AngelScript itself, please visit the [official site](https://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/).

AngelScript is under the same umbrela as [VScript](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VScript), the original scripting system developed by Valve, but has been developed as a seperate system away from VScript. Like with VScript, AngelScript runs with the currently loaded game map. AngelScript has been implemented both into the game and the Hammer level editor for Strata Source.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to using AngelScript, it is recommended for you to follow the Beginner's Guide.
