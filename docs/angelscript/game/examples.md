# Examples

This page contains a list of examples on how to use AngelScript with Strata Source games themselves.

To use the examples, create a new file inside the `(game folder)/code` folder (create the folder if it does not exist yet). `game folder` is Strata Source game sepecific, example for Portal 2: Community Edition: `p2ce`. The scripts have to be saved with the extension `.as`.

Below are examples covering several topics implemented into the latest (as of `5114609d`) Strata Source version for Portal 2: Community Edition. These examples originated from the [StrataSource/sample-content](https://github.com/StrataSource/sample-content) repository and can also be viewed from there under the `code` folder.

If you don't understand the difference between `Client`, `Server`, and `Shared`, please check out ["Client - Server model"](../guide/chapter1#client---server-model) section in the Beginner's Guide.
