## Functions

As you already know or not, functions are a way of implementing routines that operate on an input and produce a result. In Layman's terms, you give it some data, it processes the data and (may, but doesn't need to) give you an output.

A function declaration consists of 3 main parts: *return value*, *function name*, and the *parameters*.
These follow pretty much the same syntax as C++.
