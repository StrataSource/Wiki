# Hammer Examples

This page contains various examples of how to use AngelScript to create new brush types in the Strata Hammer Editor.

To use the examples, create a new file inside the `hammer/scripts` folder (create the folder if it does not exist yet). The scripts have to be saved with the extension `.as`. Afterwards, the new brush types can be used by first selecting the `Block Tool` within Hammer and then changing the `Categories` combo-box in the right bar to `Scriptable`. The combo-box `Objects` below then contains the new scripted brushes.
